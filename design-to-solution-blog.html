										<h1>From Design to Solution: Turning a Programming Plan into Code</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="./images/Design-to-solution.png" alt="image-title-text" /></span>

									<p>Before writing a single line of code, there’s a crucial step every programmer learns 
										to appreciate, designing the solution. It’s easy to jump straight into typing, but 
										taking time to think through what the program needs to do, how it will respond to user
										 input, and what could go wrong can save hours of frustration later. In this 
										 reflection, I’ll walk through how I approached a recent design assignment and how 
										 the planning process guided me from concept to working solution.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Thinking Systematically: Designing Test Cases</h2>

									<p>The first step was designing my test cases. I approached this systematically by asking 
										a few simple questions: - What exactly is the program supposed to do? - What 
										conditions will fulfill the requirements of the task? - What kinds of inputs might 
										cause errors? 
									</p>

									<span class="image left"><img src="./images/input-output.png" alt=""></span>

									<p>By thinking through these scenarios, I wasn’t just testing my code, I was testing my 
										understanding of the problem itself. Writing clear test cases helped me anticipate 
										how the program should behave before I even began coding. It also helped me identify 
										edge cases, like what would happen if the user entered something unexpected. This 
										step reminded me that planning tests early isn’t extra work, it’s what keeps 
										debugging from becoming overwhelming later on.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Using Loops to Handle Repetitions</h2>

									<p>As I worked through the logic of the assignment, I realized that certain tasks 
										required repetition. For example, the user might need to input two characters, and 
										if those inputs weren’t valid, the program would have to ask again. That’s a perfect 
										job for a loop — specifically, a do-while loop.
									</p>

									<span class="image left"><img src="./images/do-while.png" alt=""></span>

									<p>The beauty of a do-while loop is that it ensures the code runs at least once before 
										checking the condition. In this case, the program could prompt the user, check whether 
										the input was valid, and if not, automatically prompt again. Using a loop this way keeps 
										the code efficient, reduces redundancy, and creates a smoother user experience.
									</p>

									<h2>Choosing When to Use Switch Statements</h2>

									<p>
										Another design decision involved whether to use an *if statement* or a *switch 
										statement*. Both handle decision-making, but switch statements are on several specific 
										values. Instead of writing multiple `if-else` blocks, a switch checks each case neatly 
										and executes the matching one. For my program, I could use a switch statement to handle 
										valid user inputs — for instance, different cases could produce different credit card 
										numbers or responses. Each case would be clearly defined, and adding new ones later would 
										be simple. The key is to remember the `break` statement, which prevents the program from 
										accidentally running into the next case.
									</p>

									<h2>Building an Algorithm: Generating a Random Capital Letter</h2>

									<p>
										One of the most fun parts of this project was creating an algorithm to generate a random 
										capital letter. I approached it by thinking logically — the English alphabet has 26 
										letters, so I needed a way to randomly pick one. A loop could handle cycling through the 
										alphabet, and a random function could select a letter’s index. This step taught me how 
										to combine what I already knew (loops and letter ranges) with something new 
										(randomization). It also reminded me that it’s okay not to know every piece right away. 
										Researching how to use a random function or test my output was part of the 
										problem-solving process.

									<h2>Reflecting on Problem-Solving SkillsReflecting on Problem-Solving Skills</h2>

									<p>
										Overall, I’ve found that my problem-solving skills are strong when it comes to planning 
										algorithms step by step. The hardest part is making sure each planned step is specific 
										enough to translate directly into code. My strength is identifying areas I’m unsure 
										about, marking them as “to research later” keeps me moving forward instead of getting 
										stuck.
										
										Programming is as much about *thinking* as it is about *typing*. Each challenge is an 
										opportunity to slow down, break the problem apart, and find a path to the answer.
									</p>

									<h2>Conclusion: Turning Plans into Practice</h2>

									<p>
										Going from design to solution is more than just checking off coding tasks, it’s about 
										learning to think like a programmer. Every test case, loop, and algorithm builds on the 
										same foundation: systematic problem-solving. By taking the time to plan before coding, 
										I’ve learned how to write cleaner, more efficient programs and how to approach challenges 
										with curiosity instead of frustration.
